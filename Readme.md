# Project Character_manager

## Introduction
This project is a web development project that I have worked on with Tim Charlier and Cédric Wiektin. 

The original project was a group effort, but I have updated it to better suit my preferences and requirements. 

The project was undertaken as part of my training at becode.org. 

I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of Nathan Lombardelli, who provided guidance and assistance in debugging.

The code was originally commented in French, and then the comments were translated and reformulated by ChatGPT. Some comments were also entirely added by the AI.

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to learn how to contact an API of becode.org and manage a list of characters. The web application allows users to perform various actions related to managing and organizing a list of characters, such as adding new characters, editing existing ones, and deleting them.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- JavaScript
- API from becode [https://character-database.becode.xyz/]
-ChatGPT (openAI)

## Usage
Once the application is up and running, you can perform the following actions:

- Create a new character by filling out the provided form and submitting it.
- Edit the details of an existing character by selecting it from the list and modifying the fields.
- Delete a character from the list by selecting the corresponding delete button.
