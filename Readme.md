# Project Character_manager

## Introduction
This project is a web development project that I have worked on with Tim Charlier (https://github.com/timcharlier6) and Cédric Wiektin (https://github.com/cedricwietkin). 

The original project was a group effort, but I have updated it to better suit my preferences and requirements. 

The project was undertaken as part of my training at becode.org. 

I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of Nathan Lombardelli (https://github.com/NathanLombardelli), who provided guidance and assistance in debugging.

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to learn how to contact a member of becode.org and manage a list of characters. The web application allows users to perform various actions related to managing and organizing a list of characters, such as adding new characters, editing existing ones, and deleting them.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- API from becode [https://character-database.becode.xyz/]

## Usage
Once the application is up and running, you can perform the following actions:

- Create a new character by filling out the provided form and submitting it.
- Edit the details of an existing character by selecting it from the list and modifying the fields.
- Delete a character from the list by selecting the corresponding delete button.
